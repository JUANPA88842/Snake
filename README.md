## Overview

### The challenge

Build the Snake Game using data structures such as queues, stacks, dynamic array redirection, etc.

- The snake should start with a body length of three units.
- Each time the snake eats an apple, its body should increase by one unit.
- The game should end if the snake collides with itself or against one of the walls of the graphical interface.

## My process

### Built with

- Python 3.10.6
- [Turtle]([https://reactjs.org/](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)) - Python library


### What I learned

I learned how efficient it can be to use the right library to optimize program execution time. For instance, using deque() to program how the snake's body grows was a great way to ensure efficiency.
